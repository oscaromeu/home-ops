# Home Lab

Current status: _BETA_ (but pretty stable).

## 📖 Overview

This is a mono repository for my homelab infrastructure. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using the tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

This projects aims to utilize industry-standard tooling and best practices in order to both perform it's functions and for learning.
